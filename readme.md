# Project Title: Cypress-Cucumber BDD Project

## Mentor: Anshita Bhasin

## Author: Chiranjeevi Heggade

# Project Overview: 

This project demonstrates Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing with Cypress and Cucumber for UI automation. Key features include:

- Use of **Page Object Model (POM)** to organize UI interactions and improve test maintainability
- Implementation of **Cucumber** for writing BDD-style feature files with Gherkin syntax
- Reusable **step definitions** to map feature steps to Cypress commands
- Tagged tests (`@smoke`, `@negative`, etc.) for selective and organized test execution
- Use of **Cypress custom commands** for common UI actions to reduce code duplication
- Structured project folder layout following best practices for Cypress and Cucumber
- Support for running tests via **NPM scripts** with tag-based filtering
- Generation of **Cucumber HTML reports**
